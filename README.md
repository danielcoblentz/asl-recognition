# ASLConnect-ASL-Recognition-with-CNN
## Abstract
This project implements convolutional neural network models to recognize hand gestures representing numbers 0-9 in American Sign Language (ASL). Two model architectures, GestureNet and GestureNetRes, are developed and trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The models are evaluated on a custom dataset of grayscale and RGB images, achieving an accuracy of up to 95%. those models are then used to classify handgestures by the user in a seperate program

## Overview
Hand gesture recognition is a critical component in human-computer interaction, particularly for enabling communication through sign language. This project focuses on building and training CNN models to accurately classify ASL hand gestures. The models are trained on a dataset of images collected and processed specifically for this task.

## Attribution
The scaffolding for this project is not original work.
It comes from Adrian Rosebrock's PyImageSearch gesture recognition code, published as the gesture recognition material in *Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision*, where the same capture and inference loop drives a gesture passcode security system.
`CS428-CNN-1/pyimagesearch/utils/__init__.py` still carries his `__author__` tag.
What this project adds is the model architecture work, the training pipeline and the dataset.

His code, kept here essentially unchanged:

- `CS428-CNN-1/pyimagesearch/utils/conf.py` and `pyimagesearch/utils/__init__.py`, the JSON configuration loader
- `CS428-CNN-1/pyimagesearch/notifications/`, the Twilio SMS notifier from the security system, unused here
- `CS428-CNN-1/pyimagesearch/nn/gesturenet.py`, the baseline GestureNet architecture

Adapted from that same source rather than written from scratch:

- `CS428-CNN-1/gather_examples.py`, the webcam capture loop and the key-to-label mappings; the Canny edge filtering is ours
- `CS428-CNN-1/recognize.py` and `CS428-CNN-1/recognize_tflite.py`, the live capture, ROI extraction and consecutive-frame voting loop
- `CS428-CNN-1/config/config.json`, the configuration layout
- `CS428-CNN-1/pyimagesearch/nn/gesturenetres.py`, built by adding residual connections to GestureNet

Written for this project:

- the residual blocks in `gesturenetres.py`, with 1x1 convolution shortcut projections and HeNormal initialisation
- the MobileNetV3Small branch, the ExponentialDecay learning rate schedule and the model selection flag in `train_model.py`
- the filtered against unfiltered dataset ablation behind the `--filter` flag, and the dataset itself
- TensorFlow Lite export in `tflite_convert.py` and the TFLite inference path in `recognize_tflite.py`
- `figure.py` and `helper_program/`, for plotting and for parsing training logs

Features

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The data collection and preprocessing stages are critical in ensuring the models train on high-quality, representative data. Here's how we approached these stages:

- Dataset Source: We use the American Sign Language Digit Dataset available on Kaggle, which includes images of hand gestures representing digits 0-9.
- Image Acquisition: Besides the predefined dataset, we developed gather_examples.py, a script that allows users to capture images of their hand gestures using a webcam. This script guides users through capturing a balanced dataset, ensuring each gesture is well-represented.
### Preprocessing Steps:

- Grayscale Conversion: To reduce computational complexity, images are converted to grayscale, reducing the input channels from three (RGB) to one.
- Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0,1] to aid in neural network performance.
- Augmentation: To make the model robust against overfitting and to improve its ability to generalize, we apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and width shift.

#### GestureNet Model Results
Achieved an overall accuracy of 95% on the test set.
Demonstrated high precision and recall, particularly effective in distinguishing between visually similar gestures like 'six' and 'nine'.

GestureNetRes Model Results
While slightly less accurate overall at 85%, this model excelled in specific categories such as 'eight' and 'one', suggesting potential areas for further fine-tuning.
